I'm a software engineer currently working at [Shortcut](https://shortcut.com) as a backend engineer, where I've been for ten years. I primarily work in Clojure, but have experience with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript and other languages.

I live in Brooklyn with my family. When I'm not coding, I enjoy cycling and relaxing in hammocks.
